# Withdrawals Implementation Checklist

## Implementation Status: ✅ CORE REQUIREMENTS COMPLETE

This document provides an atomic task checklist for completing the Withdrawals requirements as specified in `docs/WITHDRAWALS_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

**Completed**: Phases 1, 2, and Phase 3 Tasks 3.1 & 3.2 (13 tests total - all passing)
**Remaining**: Phase 3 Task 3.3 (security tests) - Optional enhancements

---

## Phase 1: Remove FROZEN References from Requirements Doc ✅ COMPLETE

### Task 1.1: Remove FROZEN Status References ✅ COMPLETE

**Issue**: The requirements doc referenced FROZEN status in multiple locations (lines 31, 39, 594-615), but FROZEN status was removed in deposits Phase 1.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Actions Completed**:
- [x] Update `docs/WITHDRAWALS_REQUIREMENTS.md` line 31: Removed "FROZEN/" from "(not FROZEN/CLOSED)"
- [x] Update `docs/WITHDRAWALS_REQUIREMENTS.md` line 39: Removed "frozen/" from "frozen/closed accounts"
- [x] Remove FROZEN test scenario (lines 594-615): Deleted entire 22-line section
- [x] Mark Test 4 as SKIPPED in testing checklist (line 601)

---

4. ❌ Implement edge case tests 11-15
5. ❌ Implement security tests 16-19

### Priority 2: SHOULD DO (Production Readiness)
1. Verify all tests pass
2. Add database indexes for transaction queries (if not already present)
3. Add monitoring/metrics for withdrawals

### Priority 3: COULD DO (Optional Features)
1. Fraud detection
2. AML compliance checks
3. Withdrawal notifications

## Conclusion

**User Stories Status**: ✅ ALL 3 USER STORIES ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Testing Status**: ❌ NO TESTS EXIST (requirements doc incorrectly claims tests are complete)

**Requirements Doc Accuracy**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY INACCURATE
- Code implementation claims: ✅ Accurate (16/16 correct)
- Testing claims: ❌ Inaccurate (claims tests complete when none exist)
- FROZEN reference: ⚠️ Outdated (removed in deposits Phase 1)
- Bank reserve validation: ✅ Correctly NOT implemented (users can withdraw their balance)

**Next Steps**:
1. Clean up FROZEN references in requirements doc
2. Implement the 18 missing tests following this checklist
